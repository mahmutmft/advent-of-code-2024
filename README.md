# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. The solutions are organized by days and written to improve my problem-solving and algorithmic skills.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each day is in a separate folder (`Day01`, `Day02`, ..., `Day25`).  
Each folder includes:
- `input.txt` - Challenge input data.
- `main.cpp` - Solution code for the challenge.
- `puzzle.md` - Puzzle description for the day.

## 🏆 Goal

Complete all 25 challenges while improving coding skills and learning new techniques.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Navigate to the folder for the specific day (e.g., `Day01`).
2. Compile the solution:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o solution
   ```
3. Run the solution with the provided input:
   ```bash
   ./solution < input.txt
   ```
